using machine learning and deep learning techniques for fake news classification

Note : for LLM prompting, the data labels were mistakenly inverted , so accuacy should be 100% - 23% so 77% approxamitely.

I got accuracy boost with labeled data prompting and better accuracy boost with domain knowledge prompting.
